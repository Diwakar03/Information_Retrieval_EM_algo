# Information_Retrieval_EM_algo

The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is a powerful iterative method used in statistics and machine learning to find maximum likelihood estimates of parameters in probabilistic models, particularly when the data is incomplete or has missing values.

Application implementation using GMM clustering algorithm.
